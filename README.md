# Data analytics portfolio

Hello, and welcome to my data analytics portfolio. My name is Rachel Wooliver and my background is in biological and environmental research. I am currently a Research Scientist at the University of Tennessee Knoxville ([Department of Biosystems Engineering & Soil Science](https://bess.tennessee.edu/faculty-and-staff/), [Soil Management Lab](https://jagadammalab.tennessee.edu/)), and I have a PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.

I love collecting, handling, analyzing, and visualizing data. I recently completed the [Google Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/data-analytics-certificate?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=sou--google__med--organicsearch__cam--gwgsite__con--null__ter--null) on Coursera and created this portfolio as the capstone project. 

If you are interested in seeing some of my research-related work, please see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bPdT630AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and my main [GitHub page](https://github.com/rwoolive?tab=repositories).
